How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I have a huge problem with my upcoming flight. Ugh, this is so frustrating!\\n\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Can you please provide your confirmation number so I can take a look at your reservation?\\n\\nCustomer: *provides confirmation number* It's flight 3849 from Chicago to Los Angeles next Thursday. So basically, I booked this flight months ago for a really important work meeting. But now your stupid website is saying the flight is overbooked! What the hell am I supposed to do now?!\\n\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience, overbooked flights are never ideal. Let me take a look here...umm, it looks like you are correct, this flight is currently oversold. Not the news I'm sure you wanted to hear. Let me see what options I can provide to help get you to your meeting. *typing sounds* It looks like I can offer you a seat on a later departure that same day, at 5:30pm instead of the original 11am time. I'll waive the change fee since this is due to the oversale. Or I can try to get you on another airline, but it would mean going through a different airport than planned. Does either of those work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? Neither of those work - the meeting is at 10am so both those flights would have me missing it completely. This is unacceptable! Why wasn't I contacted about this sooner? Now what am I supposed to do, my whole trip is screwed!\\n\\nAgent: You're right, missing your meeting is not ideal. Let me check a few other options for you. *more typing* Unfortunately all the flights for that day are oversold as well. I can try putting you on standby for the original flight in hopes that someone doesn't show, but there's no guarantee. As for not contacting you sooner, oversales sometimes happen last minute as passengers cancel or change plans. I apologize for the lack of notice. The best I can offer is a full refund for your ticket since we can't get you there as booked. I'll also provide a $200 travel voucher for the inconvenience.\\n\\nCustomer: A refund and $200 voucher isn't going to get me to my meeting! I need to be on that flight or one that same day. This is going to cost me my job if I miss this, ugh I can't believe this. \\n\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, missing a critical business meeting because of an airline issue is unacceptable. Umm, let me check one other long shot option...it looks like I may be able to book you on a same-day red-eye on another carrier, flying out of a different airport about an hour away. It would involve renting a car and driving like crazy to make the flight, but you would land in LA around 6am, giving you time to make your 10am meeting. I know it's not ideal, but would that work in a pinch? I can get you booked on that alternate flight right now if you want to go that route.\\n\\nCustomer: *long sigh* I guess that's my only choice at this point. Yeah, go ahead and book me, I'll figure out the ride and driving. This is ridiculous. Your airline better compensate me for this huge hassle.\\n\\nAgent: I completely agree, you should not have to deal with all this trouble. Let me get you booked on that flight right now. I'm also going to credit $500 to your account for future travel due to the major inconvenience. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do as you work to make that alternate flight. And again, I sincerely apologize for the trouble. Getting customers where they need to be is the most important thing.\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Fine, I guess $500 is better than nothing. Thanks for at least getting me on another flight I suppose. This better not happen again!\\n\\nAgent: You have my word we'll do everything we can to avoid an situation like this in the future. Thank you for your patience and for being understanding - I know multiple flight changes is never ideal. Please feel free to reach back out if any other issues come up. Safe travels and I hope your meeting goes well despite the changes!\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, thanks. *hangs up phone angrily*\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for your call. *hangs up*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines customer service, this is Steve speaking. How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, thanks for taking my call. I'm calling about a flight I have booked from Chicago to London next month. Umm, I wanted to ask about changing one of the stops on the return journey.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'd be happy to take a look at your booking and see what options we have for changing that stop. What would you like to change?\\n\\nCustomer: Ah right, so currently I have a stop scheduled in Paris on the way back from London. But something's come up and I need to get back a day earlier. So I was wondering if there's a flight that stops in Amsterdam instead that would get me back a day sooner?\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation and see what flights we have. *types on keyboard, taps mouse* Hmm, it looks like the only flight with availability that stops in Amsterdam a day earlier leaves London at 6am. Would that work with your schedule change?\\n\\nCustomer: Ah not really, 6am is just too early for me. Any other options maybe with a later departure from London but still an earlier arrival back in Chicago than my current Paris stop flight? This is really important to me.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I understand the time change is important. Just one second while I take a closer look...*more typing* It looks like there is a flight that stops in Frankfurt that departs London at 9:30am and would still get you back to Chicago a day earlier than your scheduled Paris flight. Would routing through Frankfurt work instead of Amsterdam?\\n\\nCustomer: Frankfurt could work, yeah. What would be the cost to change it to that flight? I'm hoping it won't be too much more since this change is kind of last minute.\\n\\nAgent: Let me check the fare difference...*keyboard typing* Okay, because this is a routing change within two weeks of departure, there would be a $150 change fee plus the difference in fare. The Frankfurt flight is about $100 more than what you already paid for the Paris routing. So the total to change would be $150 + $100 for $250. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm, that's a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Any chance we could waive the change fee since this is sort of an emergency on my part? I've been a United customer for years and this is really first time I've needed to change a flight.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, flight changes can definitely throw a wrench in plans. Let me take a look at your loyalty account really quickly...*typing* You're right, it looks like you've been a loyal customer flying with us for 10 years, with no other changes or cancellations on your record. I think in this case we can make an exception and waive the change fee. The difference in fare would still apply, so the total to change to the Frankfurt flight would just be $100. Does that work better for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, that's much more doable. Thank you so much for your help and for waiving the fee, I really appreciate it. Okay, let's go ahead and change it to the Frankfurt flight then. You've saved my trip!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get you on that earlier flight. One moment while I process the change for you...okay, all set! Your new itinerary is confirmed with the stop in Frankfurt. Thank you for flying United and safe travels!\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks again! Have a good one.\\n\\nAgent: You too, take care!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sam. How can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sam, thanks for taking my call. I'm calling to inquire about changing the dates of my upcoming flight from New York to LA. My flight is this Friday but something has come up and I need to travel a few days later instead. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation. What's the name the ticket is booked under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's booked for John Smith.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, got it. Let me take a look at our flight options for later dates. Umm, it looks like we have seats available on Sunday and Monday. Would one of those days work better for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, those dates would work. What would the cost be to change it to one of those days? I'm hoping it won't be too much more than what I already paid. \\n\\nAgent: *typing noises* Just one second while I check the fare difference... Alright, it looks like we can change you to the Sunday flight and the additional charge would only be $50 more than your original ticket. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: You know, that's actually not too bad. I was expecting a much bigger change fee. Sunday will work then, go ahead and switch me over to that flight.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that fit your schedule and budget. Just give me a moment here to process the change...okay, all set! You're now booked on the Sunday flight from New York to LA. The additional $50 will be charged to the credit card we have on file. Thank you for being so flexible on your dates - I'm sure this will make your travel plans a little less stressful. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sam. I really appreciate you getting me switched over to the new flight.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome! I'm glad we could work something out. Safe travels and enjoy your trip.

How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I have a huge problem with my upcoming flight. Ugh, this is so frustrating!\\n\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Can you please provide your confirmation number so I can take a look at your reservation?\\n\\nCustomer: *provides confirmation number* It's flight 3849 from Chicago to Los Angeles next Thursday. So basically, I booked this flight months ago for a really important work meeting. But now your stupid website is saying the flight is overbooked! What the hell am I supposed to do now?!\\n\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience, overbooked flights are never ideal. Let me take a look here...umm, it looks like you are correct, this flight is currently oversold. Not the news I'm sure you wanted to hear. Let me see what options I can provide to help get you to your meeting. *typing sounds* It looks like I can offer you a seat on a later departure that same day, at 5:30pm instead of the original 11am time. I'll waive the change fee since this is due to the oversale. Or I can try to get you on another airline, but it would mean going through a different airport than planned. Does either of those work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? Neither of those work - the meeting is at 10am so both those flights would have me missing it completely. This is unacceptable! Why wasn't I contacted about this sooner? Now what am I supposed to do, my whole trip is screwed!\\n\\nAgent: You're right, missing your meeting is not ideal. Let me check a few other options for you. *more typing* Unfortunately all the flights for that day are oversold as well. I can try putting you on standby for the original flight in hopes that someone doesn't show, but there's no guarantee. As for not contacting you sooner, oversales sometimes happen last minute as passengers cancel or change plans. I apologize for the lack of notice. The best I can offer is a full refund for your ticket since we can't get you there as booked. I'll also provide a $200 travel voucher for the inconvenience.\\n\\nCustomer: A refund and $200 voucher isn't going to get me to my meeting! I need to be on that flight or one that same day. This is going to cost me my job if I miss this, ugh I can't believe this. \\n\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, missing a critical business meeting because of an airline issue is unacceptable. Umm, let me check one other long shot option...it looks like I may be able to book you on a same-day red-eye on another carrier, flying out of a different airport about an hour away. It would involve renting a car and driving like crazy to make the flight, but you would land in LA around 6am, giving you time to make your 10am meeting. I know it's not ideal, but would that work in a pinch? I can get you booked on that alternate flight right now if you want to go that route.\\n\\nCustomer: *long sigh* I guess that's my only choice at this point. Yeah, go ahead and book me, I'll figure out the ride and driving. This is ridiculous. Your airline better compensate me for this huge hassle.\\n\\nAgent: I completely agree, you should not have to deal with all this trouble. Let me get you booked on that flight right now. I'm also going to credit $500 to your account for future travel due to the major inconvenience. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do as you work to make that alternate flight. And again, I sincerely apologize for the trouble. Getting customers where they need to be is the most important thing.\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Fine, I guess $500 is better than nothing. Thanks for at least getting me on another flight I suppose. This better not happen again!\\n\\nAgent: You have my word we'll do everything we can to avoid an situation like this in the future. Thank you for your patience and for being understanding - I know multiple flight changes is never ideal. Please feel free to reach back out if any other issues come up. Safe travels and I hope your meeting goes well despite the changes!\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, thanks. *hangs up phone angrily*\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for your call. *hangs up*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines customer service, this is Steve speaking. How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, thanks for taking my call. I'm calling about a flight I have booked from Chicago to London next month. Umm, I wanted to ask about changing one of the stops on the return journey.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'd be happy to take a look at your booking and see what options we have for changing that stop. What would you like to change?\\n\\nCustomer: Ah right, so currently I have a stop scheduled in Paris on the way back from London. But something's come up and I need to get back a day earlier. So I was wondering if there's a flight that stops in Amsterdam instead that would get me back a day sooner?\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation and see what flights we have. *types on keyboard, taps mouse* Hmm, it looks like the only flight with availability that stops in Amsterdam a day earlier leaves London at 6am. Would that work with your schedule change?\\n\\nCustomer: Ah not really, 6am is just too early for me. Any other options maybe with a later departure from London but still an earlier arrival back in Chicago than my current Paris stop flight? This is really important to me.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I understand the time change is important. Just one second while I take a closer look...*more typing* It looks like there is a flight that stops in Frankfurt that departs London at 9:30am and would still get you back to Chicago a day earlier than your scheduled Paris flight. Would routing through Frankfurt work instead of Amsterdam?\\n\\nCustomer: Frankfurt could work, yeah. What would be the cost to change it to that flight? I'm hoping it won't be too much more since this change is kind of last minute.\\n\\nAgent: Let me check the fare difference...*keyboard typing* Okay, because this is a routing change within two weeks of departure, there would be a $150 change fee plus the difference in fare. The Frankfurt flight is about $100 more than what you already paid for the Paris routing. So the total to change would be $150 + $100 for $250. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm, that's a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Any chance we could waive the change fee since this is sort of an emergency on my part? I've been a United customer for years and this is really first time I've needed to change a flight.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, flight changes can definitely throw a wrench in plans. Let me take a look at your loyalty account really quickly...*typing* You're right, it looks like you've been a loyal customer flying with us for 10 years, with no other changes or cancellations on your record. I think in this case we can make an exception and waive the change fee. The difference in fare would still apply, so the total to change to the Frankfurt flight would just be $100. Does that work better for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Yes, that's much more doable. Thank you so much for your help and for waiving the fee, I really appreciate it. Okay, let's go ahead and change it to the Frankfurt flight then. You've saved my trip!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get you on that earlier flight. One moment while I process the change for you...okay, all set! Your new itinerary is confirmed with the stop in Frankfurt. Thank you for flying United and safe travels!\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks again! Have a good one.\\n\\nAgent: You too, take care!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sam. How can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sam, thanks for taking my call. I'm calling to inquire about changing the dates of my upcoming flight from New York to LA. My flight is this Friday but something has come up and I need to travel a few days later instead. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation. What's the name the ticket is booked under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's booked for John Smith.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, got it. Let me take a look at our flight options for later dates. Umm, it looks like we have seats available on Sunday and Monday. Would one of those days work better for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, those dates would work. What would the cost be to change it to one of those days? I'm hoping it won't be too much more than what I already paid. \\n\\nAgent: *typing noises* Just one second while I check the fare difference... Alright, it looks like we can change you to the Sunday flight and the additional charge would only be $50 more than your original ticket. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: You know, that's actually not too bad. I was expecting a much bigger change fee. Sunday will work then, go ahead and switch me over to that flight.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that fit your schedule and budget. Just give me a moment here to process the change...okay, all set! You're now booked on the Sunday flight from New York to LA. The additional $50 will be charged to the credit card we have on file. Thank you for being so flexible on your dates - I'm sure this will make your travel plans a little less stressful. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sam. I really appreciate you getting me switched over to the new flight.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome! I'm glad we could work something out. Safe travels and enjoy your trip.

How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, I'm calling because I have a problem with my flight tomorrow. Ugh, I'm so frustrated with you guys. \\n\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. May I have your confirmation number so I can pull up your reservation?\\n\\nCustomer: It's P4563217. Look, I booked this flight months ago to visit my family and now you're telling me it's been cancelled? \\n\\nAgent: One moment while I take a look...okay, it looks like your flight from Chicago to Houston for tomorrow was cancelled due to maintenance issues. I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see what options I can give you for getting to Houston. *typing noises* It looks like we have another flight leaving in a few hours that will get you there only an hour later than originally planned. How does that sound?\\n\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? An hour later isn't good enough, I told you this trip is really important to see my family. Don't you have anything earlier? \\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear this trip is so important. Let me check a few other airlines as well to see if we can get you there sooner. *more typing* Unfortunately it looks like most flights are booked up due to the holidays. The best I can offer on United is a 5:30pm flight that will get you into Houston at 8:15pm. I know that's still later than you wanted but it is a few hours earlier. Does that work or would you like me to see about alternative travel options like driving or taking a train?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine I guess I'll take the 5:30 flight. But you better give me a travel credit or something since I now have to reschedule my whole visit because of your stupid maintenance issues. \\n\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration with the change. Let me issue you a $150 travel credit that can be used on any United flight within the next year as an apology for the disruption. Does that seem fair to you? I'll go ahead and get you booked on the 5:30 flight today and send you an email confirmation. Please let me know if you need anything else.\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah ok, that credit will have to do I guess. Thanks for your help but I'm still not happy about this whole thing. \\n\\nAgent: I don't blame you at all for being unhappy, it's definitely not the experience we aim to provide. I hope the travel credit helps make up for some of the hassle. Please reach back out if you need anything further for your trip. And thank you for flying United, despite the issues I hope you have a good rest of your day.\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, thanks. *hangs up phone*\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for your call. *phone line hangs up*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines customer service, how may I help you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, I'm calling to complain about a flight I took last week from New York to San Francisco. The flight was a complete nightmare.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Can you tell me what happened?\\n\\nCustomer: Well first of all, our flight was delayed by over 3 hours! No one seemed to know what was going on. We just sat on the plane forever with no updates. A lot of people missed connecting flights because of it. \\n\\nAgent: Umm, yeah delays are never good. Let me pull up the flight details and see if I can find out why it was delayed. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like there was an issue with the plane's navigation system that needed to be repaired before takeoff. Definitely not ideal, but safety had to come first. What else went wrong?\\n\\nCustomer: After we finally took off, it seemed like the pilot was hitting every bit of turbulence possible. It was the bumpiest flight ever. A lot of people got sick. And to top it all off, the snack they gave us was stale and disgusting. \\n\\nAgent: Ah man, that does sound really unpleasant. I'm sorry you had such a rough flight. *pause* It looks like there was some bad weather along that route that day which could explain the extra turbulence. As for the snack, that's definitely not acceptable. Was there anything else that could help resolve this? Perhaps a refund or future travel credit?\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah I'd like a refund for the whole trip. This was supposed to be a fun vacation but the flight there totally ruined it. Also, I had to miss a day of work because of the delay and I'm out that money too. You guys really need to do better.\\n\\nAgent: You know, I completely understand your frustration. Delays, turbulence, and bad snacks - that's no way to travel. *sighs* Let me go ahead and process a full refund of the airfare for you. And I'll also credit you for the day of work you missed due to the delay. How does that sound as resolution? \\n\\nCustomer: I guess that will have to do. But you better make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. You're losing a lot of customers with service like this. \\n\\nAgent: You're right, we need to do better. I'll be sure to note the issues you experienced on this flight to help prevent similar problems in the future. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback - it will really help us to improve. I hope the refund and credit help make up for some of the trouble. Please fly with us again and I hope next time is a much smoother experience.\\n\\nCustomer: We'll see. Thanks for your help I guess. *call ending noises*\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome. Thanks for calling United, and have a good rest of your day. \\n\\n*call ends*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is David.

The flight was delayed for over 3 hours and I missed my connecting flight. \\n\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience and frustration. May I have your confirmation number so I can look up the details of your flight?\\n\\nCustomer: *customer provides confirmation number* Ugh, I just don't understand how it took so long to get the flight in the air. We were just sitting on the runway the whole time. \\n\\nAgent: Let me take a look here...okay, I see the details. It looks like there was an issue with the aircraft that caused a lengthy delay for maintenance and repairs before you all could depart. I completely understand your frustration with missing your connecting flight due to the delay. *typing sounds* Unfortunately it doesn't look like we were able to rebook you on an alternate routing that day. \\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, it was a mess. And now I'm out over $200 for having to rebook my own flights. Is there any way United can compensate me for this? It's not like I wanted to spend an extra day in that city because of your delay!\\n\\nAgent: I can certainly understand your frustration with the extra costs involved. Let me see what options we have as far as compensation. We do offer vouchers for delays and cancellations within our control that result in overnight stays or other significant costs to our customers. *more typing* According to our records, this delay appears to have been due to a mechanical issue which does make you eligible for compensation. I'd be happy to provide you with a $200 travel voucher that can be used for future United travel to offset the costs you incurred. Will that work for you?\\n\\nCustomer: *sigh of relief* Yeah, I guess that will have to do. It still doesn't make up for the hassle of it all but at least it's something. Thanks I appreciate you helping with that. \\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could provide some assistance. Thank you for your patience and for flying with United.

How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, I'm calling because I have a problem with my flight tomorrow. Ugh, I'm so frustrated with you guys. \\n\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. May I have your confirmation number so I can pull up your reservation?\\n\\nCustomer: It's P4563217. Look, I booked this flight months ago to visit my family and now you're telling me it's been cancelled? \\n\\nAgent: One moment while I take a look...okay, it looks like your flight from Chicago to Houston for tomorrow was cancelled due to maintenance issues. I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see what options I can give you for getting to Houston. *typing noises* It looks like we have another flight leaving in a few hours that will get you there only an hour later than originally planned. How does that sound?\\n\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? An hour later isn't good enough, I told you this trip is really important to see my family. Don't you have anything earlier? \\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear this trip is so important. Let me check a few other airlines as well to see if we can get you there sooner. *more typing* Unfortunately it looks like most flights are booked up due to the holidays. The best I can offer on United is a 5:30pm flight that will get you into Houston at 8:15pm. I know that's still later than you wanted but it is a few hours earlier. Does that work or would you like me to see about alternative travel options like driving or taking a train?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine I guess I'll take the 5:30 flight. But you better give me a travel credit or something since I now have to reschedule my whole visit because of your stupid maintenance issues. \\n\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration with the change. Let me issue you a $150 travel credit that can be used on any United flight within the next year as an apology for the disruption. Does that seem fair to you? I'll go ahead and get you booked on the 5:30 flight today and send you an email confirmation. Please let me know if you need anything else.\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah ok, that credit will have to do I guess. Thanks for your help but I'm still not happy about this whole thing. \\n\\nAgent: I don't blame you at all for being unhappy, it's definitely not the experience we aim to provide. I hope the travel credit helps make up for some of the hassle. Please reach back out if you need anything further for your trip. And thank you for flying United, despite the issues I hope you have a good rest of your day.\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, thanks. *hangs up phone*\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for your call. *phone line hangs up*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines customer service, how may I help you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, I'm calling to complain about a flight I took last week from New York to San Francisco. The flight was a complete nightmare.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Can you tell me what happened?\\n\\nCustomer: Well first of all, our flight was delayed by over 3 hours! No one seemed to know what was going on. We just sat on the plane forever with no updates. A lot of people missed connecting flights because of it. \\n\\nAgent: Umm, yeah delays are never good. Let me pull up the flight details and see if I can find out why it was delayed. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like there was an issue with the plane's navigation system that needed to be repaired before takeoff. Definitely not ideal, but safety had to come first. What else went wrong?\\n\\nCustomer: After we finally took off, it seemed like the pilot was hitting every bit of turbulence possible. It was the bumpiest flight ever. A lot of people got sick. And to top it all off, the snack they gave us was stale and disgusting. \\n\\nAgent: Ah man, that does sound really unpleasant. I'm sorry you had such a rough flight. *pause* It looks like there was some bad weather along that route that day which could explain the extra turbulence. As for the snack, that's definitely not acceptable. Was there anything else that could help resolve this? Perhaps a refund or future travel credit?\\n\\nCustomer: Yeah I'd like a refund for the whole trip. This was supposed to be a fun vacation but the flight there totally ruined it. Also, I had to miss a day of work because of the delay and I'm out that money too. You guys really need to do better.\\n\\nAgent: You know, I completely understand your frustration. Delays, turbulence, and bad snacks - that's no way to travel. *sighs* Let me go ahead and process a full refund of the airfare for you. And I'll also credit you for the day of work you missed due to the delay. How does that sound as resolution? \\n\\nCustomer: I guess that will have to do. But you better make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. You're losing a lot of customers with service like this. \\n\\nAgent: You're right, we need to do better. I'll be sure to note the issues you experienced on this flight to help prevent similar problems in the future. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback - it will really help us to improve. I hope the refund and credit help make up for some of the trouble. Please fly with us again and I hope next time is a much smoother experience.\\n\\nCustomer: We'll see. Thanks for your help I guess. *call ending noises*\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome. Thanks for calling United, and have a good rest of your day. \\n\\n*call ends*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is David. How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi, umm I'm really frustrated about this flight I took last week. The flight was delayed for over 3 hours and I missed my connecting flight. \\n\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience and frustration. May I have your confirmation number so I can look up the details of your flight?\\n\\nCustomer: *customer provides confirmation number* Ugh, I just don't understand how it took so long to get the flight in the air. We were just sitting on the runway the whole time. \\n\\nAgent: Let me take a look here...okay, I see the details. It looks like there was an issue with the aircraft that caused a lengthy delay for maintenance and repairs before you all could depart. I completely understand your frustration with missing your connecting flight due to the delay. *typing sounds* Unfortunately it doesn't look like we were able to rebook you on an alternate routing that day. \\n\\nCustomer: Yeah, it was a mess. And now I'm out over $200 for having to rebook my own flights. Is there any way United can compensate me for this? It's not like I wanted to spend an extra day in that city because of your delay!\\n\\nAgent: I can certainly understand your frustration with the extra costs involved. Let me see what options we have as far as compensation. We do offer vouchers for delays and cancellations within our control that result in overnight stays or other significant costs to our customers. *more typing* According to our records, this delay appears to have been due to a mechanical issue which does make you eligible for compensation. I'd be happy to provide you with a $200 travel voucher that can be used for future United travel to offset the costs you incurred. Will that work for you?\\n\\nCustomer: *sigh of relief* Yeah, I guess that will have to do. It still doesn't make up for the hassle of it all but at least it's something. Thanks I appreciate you helping with that. \\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could provide some assistance. Thank you for your patience and for flying with United. I hope the rest of your travels go smoothly.
